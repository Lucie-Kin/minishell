- Even if we can't resolve the unclosed quote because of a signal, the line is 
added to history and simply not executed. Whatever has been appended with extra 
input is of course part of what's in history.
- If EOF while prompting for quote:
	bash: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
	bash: syntax error: unexpected end of file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A shell, which includes Bigerrno, shouldn't be able to be put to the 
background using the SIGTSTP signal (Ctrl-Z). Since Bigerrno is a mere program, 
our role is to make sure to ignore SIGTSTP.
- We'll actually ignore more than this one signal. All of them besides those 
required by the subject: SIGINT (Ctrl-C), EOT (Ctrl-D) and SIGQUIT (Ctrl-\). 
Note that SIGKILL is the only signal we're unable to catch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The current input is an array of lines.
- Append the current line to the previous one, unless it heredoc content. 
If so, leave them as individual lines. The delimiter is its own line, and you 
continue non-heredoc content in another line if there's any.
- If a Ctrl-C signal happens, discard the current line, join all the lines into 
the final history entry, and don't send input to the executor.
- If a Ctrl-D signal happens, and the current line is not empty, you ignore the 
signal. If the line is empty, and the prompt is NOT for an unclosed quote: add 
all the lines to history, which means that each individual lines are as many 
history entries, then you exit. If it's empty and was for an unclosed quote, 
the current line is merely "\n" (unless it was the first prompt of the current 
input; yes you have "\n" even if it's the first prompt of the unclosed quote 
but there was a prompt for something else before that), you join all the lines 
into the final history entry, and don't send input to the executor.
